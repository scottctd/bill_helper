## Prompt And Tooling Rules

- prompt policy is organized into explicit sections for tool discipline, proposal workflows, execution, and final response behavior
- prompt rendering carries a run surface hint so Telegram-directed turns can request plain-text-friendly final answers
- `Current User Context` includes timezone/date bullets plus `Entity Category Reference` and `Account Context`
- `Agent Memory` is rendered as a markdown unordered list built from persisted runtime-setting memory items
- the model-visible tool catalog is intentionally small: `rename_thread`, `send_intermediate_update`, `add_user_memory`, and `terminal`
- app-state reads and proposal lifecycle work now flow through the workspace terminal and the installed `bh` CLI rather than the older large direct read/proposal tool list
- duplicate-entry checks should happen before new entry proposals
- tag/entity naming should stay canonical and generalized
- tag-delete proposals may proceed while referenced; proposal previews should surface impact counts and apply removes entry junction rows by cascade
- `send_intermediate_update` is required as the first tool call when tool work is needed
- `add_user_memory` is an add-only tool for explicit remember-this requests; mutate/remove requests must be declined
- `rename_thread` should run right after the first user message in a new thread, then only when the user explicitly asks or the topic materially changes
- untitled threads are runtime-gated to expose only the `rename_thread` tool on the first model step; most models also receive an explicit required `tool_choice`, but `openrouter/qwen/qwen3.5-27b` falls back to tool-list restriction only because OpenRouter rejects explicit `tool_choice` for that model in thinking mode
- `terminal` injects backend URL, a short-lived bearer session, current thread id, and current run id on every execution; the agent does not supply those manually
- the prompt has a dedicated `Grouping` section that combines fixed `BUNDLE` / `SPLIT` / `RECURRING` semantics, examples, and workflow guidance
- after proposing a new entry, the prompt instructs the agent to check whether an existing recurring, split, or bundle group should absorb it and to propose the membership change when needed
- group membership proposals may reference pending `create_group` and `create_entry` proposal ids in the same thread; approval is blocked until those dependencies are applied
- stored group-member proposal payloads canonicalize existing `group_id` / `entry_id` aliases and pending create-proposal ids to their full ids so pending-conflict detection, dependency blocking, and apply all operate on the same references

## Agent Router

- `backend/routers/agent.py`
  - thin aggregator that includes the split HTTP modules below
- `backend/routers/agent_dashboard.py`
  - agent dashboard analytics HTTP translation
- `backend/routers/agent_threads.py`
  - thread list/detail plus message-send and stream endpoints
- `backend/routers/agent_runs.py`
  - run detail, tool-call detail, and interrupt endpoints
- `backend/routers/agent_proposals.py`
  - thread-scoped proposal list/get/create HTTP translation for the `bh` CLI
- `backend/routers/agent_reviews.py`
  - approve/reject/reopen HTTP translation for review actions
- `backend/routers/agent_attachments.py`
  - attachment file download endpoint
- `backend/routers/agent_threads.py`
  - also owns the message-create HTTP translation, SSE event formatting, and background-session launch helpers used only by the thread send endpoints
- delegates message validation and run lifecycle policy to `backend/services/agent/execution.py`
- accepts an optional `surface` form field on message-send routes and persists it onto the created run for background continuation
- delegates canonical upload storage to `backend/services/user_files.py` through `backend/services/agent/execution.py`
- starts background runs with injected session factories from `get_session_maker()`
- all agent endpoints require an explicit authenticated request principal; non-admin users are scoped to their own threads while admins can access every thread

Endpoints:

- `GET /api/v1/agent/threads`
- `POST /api/v1/agent/threads`
- `PATCH /api/v1/agent/threads/{thread_id}`
- `DELETE /api/v1/agent/threads/{thread_id}`

- `GET /api/v1/agent/attachments/{attachment_id}`

## Thread Detail Behavior

- `GET /api/v1/agent/threads/{thread_id}` returns `current_context_tokens`
- message-send endpoints accept optional multipart `model_name`; when present it must match one of the resolved runtime `available_agent_models`
- thread detail returns compact tool-call snapshots by default (`has_full_payload=false`)
- thread detail keeps `configured_model_name` as the resolved runtime default while each run persists its own `model_name`; `current_context_tokens` follows the newest run model when a thread already has runs
- full tool payloads are fetched through `GET /api/v1/agent/tool-calls/{tool_call_id}`
- runs persist ordered `events[]` rows for replayable timeline activity
- runs also carry their `change_items`; the frontend flattens those per-run proposal lists into one thread review model
- serializer output skips legacy persisted change rows whose enum values are still recognized for hydration but no longer part of the supported client review surface
- run snapshots aggregate usage metrics and derived USD pricing; prompt-side costs use cache-aware LiteLLM rates when cache usage is present and stay folded into the existing `input_cost_usd`/`total_cost_usd` fields
- `GET /api/v1/agent/dashboard` rolls those persisted run usage counters into principal-scoped KPI cards, cost timeline buckets, model/surface breakdowns, and top expensive-run rows for the dashboard UI

## Current Agent Execution Behavior

- runs support both background execution and SSE execution
- each run persists a `surface` hint so later execution and polling can distinguish Telegram-originated runs from default app runs
- streamed runs emit transient `reasoning_delta`, `text_delta`, and ordered persisted `run_event` rows
- streamed tool lifecycle `run_event` payloads include a compact top-level `tool_call` snapshot so clients can render the tool name immediately without fetching full payloads
- clients may hydrate a streamed `rename_thread` tool call immediately and update the visible thread title before the final assistant message arrives
- `send_intermediate_update` is persisted as a `reasoning_update` event, not as a fake tool call
- malformed tool-call JSON now persists an explicit tool-call error with raw argument text and decode metadata instead of being silently rewritten to an empty argument object
- attachment-bearing user turns reach the model as ordered content parts: attachment text, then attachment images, then the typed user prompt
- new agent uploads are written into the canonical per-user store under `{data_dir}/user_files/{owner_user_id}/uploads/...`, and `agent_message_attachments` link to those canonical rows instead of owning file metadata directly
- PDFs use PyMuPDF first and then local Tesseract OCR only when native text extraction fails
- interruption marks runs as `failed` and injects interruption context into the next turn
- pending proposals remain inspectable in later turns while still `PENDING_REVIEW`
- reviewed proposal context now includes reviewer override values when `payload_override` changed the approved payload, so later turns can see concrete edited values instead of only changed field names
- run snapshots expose persisted `surface`, explicit `reply_surface`, and `terminal_assistant_reply`, so read-time formatting overrides do not masquerade as the stored run surface
- deleting a thread removes attachment linkage rows but intentionally leaves canonical uploaded payload files in place
- the active agent runtime now exposes full workspace terminal execution through `terminal`; app-state operations are expected to go through the installed `bh` CLI inside that terminal
- proposal HTTP routes are thread-scoped and require `X-Bill-Helper-Agent-Run-Id` so `bh` can keep new proposals attached to the invoking run

## Review And Apply Behavior

- `backend/services/agent/reviews/` accepts reviewer `payload_override` for create/update entry, tag, entity, and group proposals across approve, reject, and reopen actions while leaving `APPLIED` items immutable
- invalid reviewer overrides fail during payload normalization and leave the proposal unchanged instead of marking it `APPLY_FAILED`
- review workflow failures now surface through typed `PolicyViolation` statuses instead of router-local `ValueError` string matching, so approve/reject/reopen keep one error contract for `400`, `409`, and `422` responses
- group-member approvals that reference pending `create_group` / `create_entry` proposals are blocked until those dependencies are applied; rejected or failed dependencies leave the member proposal unapprovable until edited or removed
- apply-time group-member resolution canonicalizes existing short `group_id` and `entry_id` aliases to full ids before scoped lookup and membership matching, so approval semantics match proposal-time alias handling
- review apply uses the approving reviewer principal for principal-scoped entry lookup and for owner attribution on newly created entry/account/group resources; mutable runtime settings remain only as a non-request fallback
- group proposal creation still re-runs normalization and conflict checks so duplicate or conflicting group/member proposals are rejected inside one thread
- `backend/services/agent/apply/` owns the actual domain mutation after approval, including group create/rename/delete and group membership add/remove
- `backend/services/agent/message_history_prefixes.py` prepends compact review outcome lines before the next user feedback message and includes `review_override=...` when reviewer edits changed the applied payload
- group-member proposal previews now carry enough entry fields, including `markdown_notes`, for the frontend to render a locked full-entry snapshot during review
