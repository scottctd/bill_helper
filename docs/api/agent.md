# API Agent

All agent routes require an authenticated principal.

Scope rules:

- non-admin principals can access only their own threads and all child resources under those threads
- admin principals can access any thread and may impersonate a user when they need an exact end-user scope
- thread-scoped proposal routes also require `X-Bill-Helper-Agent-Run-Id` so the backend can associate new or revised proposals with the active agent run that invoked `bh`

## Threads

### `GET /agent/threads`

List threads in most-recently-updated order. Response: `AgentThreadSummaryRead[]`

Behavior:

- returns the caller's threads
- admin callers receive all threads
- each row includes `last_message_preview`, `pending_change_count`, and `has_running_run`

### `POST /agent/threads`

Create a thread. Body: optional `title`. Response: `201 AgentThreadRead`

Behavior:

- the new thread is owned by the authenticated principal
- if no title is supplied, the thread remains untitled until a later explicit rename

### `PATCH /agent/threads/{thread_id}`

Rename one thread. Body: `{ "title": string }`. Response: `AgentThreadRead`

Validation:

- title is normalized for internal whitespace
- title must contain 1-5 words
- title must be 80 characters or fewer

### `DELETE /agent/threads/{thread_id}`

Delete one thread and its persisted timeline artifacts. Response: `204`

Behavior:

- lookup is thread-owner scoped
- cascades deletes for messages, runs, tool calls, change items, and review actions
- keeps canonical uploaded file payloads under `{data_dir}/user_files/{owner_user_id}/uploads/...`
- rejects delete when any run in the thread is still running

Errors:

- `404` thread not found
- `409` active running run exists

### `GET /agent/threads/{thread_id}`

Fetch timeline-ready thread detail. Response: `AgentThreadDetailRead`

Includes:

- `thread`
- `messages`
- `runs`
- per-run `change_items`
- `configured_model_name`
- `current_context_tokens`
- compact tool-call snapshots by default
- ordered run `events[]`
- nullable usage counters and derived pricing fields

## Message Send

### `POST /agent/threads/{thread_id}/messages`

Create a user message and run the agent in background.

Content type: `multipart/form-data`

Form fields:

- `content` (optional if files are present)
- `model_name` (optional explicit model selection; must match one of the `available_agent_models` returned by `GET /settings`)
- `surface` (`app` by default; `telegram` enables Telegram-safe prompt and reply shaping)
- `files` (0..N image or PDF attachments)

Behavior:

- thread lookup is owner-scoped
- validates attachment count and size limits
- persists the message and stores uploaded attachments under `{data_dir}/user_files/{owner_user_id}/uploads/...`
- creates an `agent_runs` row with initial `status=running`
- starts bounded tool-calling execution in background
- PDFs are parsed with PyMuPDF first; vision-capable models also receive rendered page images
- provider routing resolves through LiteLLM using the requested `model_name` when supplied, otherwise the configured default model
- proposal tool outputs include `proposal_id` and `proposal_short_id`

Response: `AgentRunRead`

Errors:

- `400` invalid payload
- `400` selected `model_name` is not enabled in runtime settings
- `404` thread not found
- `503` provider credentials unavailable

### `POST /agent/threads/{thread_id}/messages/stream`

Create a user message and run the agent with SSE.

Content type: `multipart/form-data`

Form fields:

- `content` (optional if files are present)
- `surface` (`app` by default; `telegram` enables Telegram-safe prompt and reply shaping)
- `files` (0..N image or PDF attachments)

Behavior:

- uses the same validation and persistence rules as the non-stream endpoint
- executes in-request and streams incremental events
- if the client disconnects, the run continues in background
- response payload shape stays aligned with the non-stream endpoint

Response content type: `text/event-stream`

Event contract:

- `reasoning_delta`
- `text_delta`
- `run_event`
  - shape: `{ type, run_id, event, tool_call? }`
  - `tool_call` is present only for tool lifecycle events and uses the compact `AgentToolCallRead` shape (`has_full_payload=false`)
  - `rename_thread` starts streaming as a compact tool-call event before the final assistant message

Usage notes:

- usage totals are persisted on the run record and read from snapshot endpoints
- cache-aware pricing still rolls into the existing `input_cost_usd` and `total_cost_usd` fields
- retries after partial streamed text suppress already-emitted prefixes
- Telegram transport clients typically send `surface=telegram` here and later read `GET /agent/runs/{run_id}?surface=telegram`

## Runs And Tool Calls

### `GET /agent/runs/{run_id}`

Get a run snapshot. Response: `AgentRunRead`

Behavior:

- lookup is owner-scoped through the parent thread
- optional query param `surface` (`app` or `telegram`) overrides terminal-reply formatting for this read only
- payload includes lifecycle metadata, full tool calls (`has_full_payload=true`), change items, usage counters, and derived pricing fields

### `GET /agent/tool-calls/{tool_call_id}`

Get one fully hydrated tool-call payload. Response: `AgentToolCallRead`

Behavior:

- lookup is owner-scoped through the parent thread

Errors:

- `404` tool call not found

### `POST /agent/runs/{run_id}/interrupt`

Interrupt a currently running run. Response: `AgentRunRead`

Behavior:

- lookup is owner-scoped through the parent thread
- running runs are marked `failed` with `error_text = "Run interrupted by user."`
- already terminal runs are returned unchanged

Errors:

- `404` run not found

## Review Actions

## Thread-Scoped Proposals

### `GET /agent/threads/{thread_id}/proposals`

List proposals in one thread. Response: `AgentProposalListRead`

Query params:

- `proposal_type`
- `proposal_status`
- `change_action`
- `proposal_id`
- `limit`

Behavior:

- uses the same thread-scoped proposal history model as the prior internal proposal-history tooling
- accepts canonical proposal ids only; `bh` resolves displayed short ids before the final API call
- returns proposal summaries, payloads, review metadata, and timestamps

### `GET /agent/threads/{thread_id}/proposals/{proposal_id}`

Fetch one proposal by canonical full id. Response: `AgentProposalRecordRead`

Errors:

- `404` proposal not found

### `POST /agent/threads/{thread_id}/proposals`

Create one review-gated proposal in the active thread/run. Response: `201 AgentProposalRecordRead`

Body:

- `change_type`
- `payload_json`

Behavior:

- validates payloads with the same normalization/ownership rules used by the internal proposal handlers
- associates the new `AgentChangeItem` with the active run from `X-Bill-Helper-Agent-Run-Id`
- supports the full current proposal set: entry, account, snapshot, group, group-member, tag, and entity changes

### `PATCH /agent/threads/{thread_id}/proposals/{proposal_id}`

Update one pending proposal by canonical full id. Response: `AgentProposalRecordRead`

Body:

- `patch_map`

Behavior:

- only `PENDING_REVIEW` proposals are mutable
- validates patch-map roots by change type before applying the update
- validates the patched payload against the stored proposal payload contract before saving it

Errors:

- `400` invalid patch or proposal is not pending
- `404` proposal not found

### `DELETE /agent/threads/{thread_id}/proposals/{proposal_id}`

Remove one pending proposal by canonical full id. Response: `204 No Content`

Behavior:

- only `PENDING_REVIEW` proposals are removable

Errors:

- `400` proposal is not pending
- `404` proposal not found

### `POST /agent/change-items/{item_id}/approve`

Approve and apply one proposal item. Response: `AgentChangeItemRead`

Body:

- `note` (optional)
- `payload_override` (optional; supported for `create_entry`, `update_entry`, `create_group`, `update_group`, `create_group_member`, `create_tag`, `update_tag`, `create_entity`, and `update_entity`)

State rules:

- allowed for any non-`APPLIED` item
- returns `409` if already applied
- transitions to `APPLY_FAILED` on apply failure

Apply behavior covers:

- entry create, update, and soft-delete
- group create, rename, delete, and direct-member add/remove
- tag create, update, and delete
- entity create, update, and delete
- account create, update, delete, and snapshot operations when present in the pending proposal set

Notes:

- lookup is owner-scoped through the parent thread
- reviewer edits are sent through `payload_override`
- invalid `payload_override` payloads return `422` and leave the item unchanged
- apply uses the approving principal for scoped resolution and owner attribution
- when reviewer edits are present, later agent turns receive a compact `review_override=...` summary in the prepended review-results context

### `POST /agent/change-items/{item_id}/reject`

Reject one proposal item. Response: `AgentChangeItemRead`

Body:

- `note` (optional)
- `payload_override` (optional)

Behavior:

- lookup is owner-scoped through the parent thread

### `POST /agent/change-items/{item_id}/reopen`

Move one reviewed item back to `PENDING_REVIEW`. Response: `AgentChangeItemRead`

Body:

- `note` (optional)
- `payload_override` (optional)

Behavior:

- lookup is owner-scoped through the parent thread

## Attachments

### `GET /agent/attachments/{attachment_id}`

Download a stored attachment. Response: file body

Behavior:

- lookup is owner-scoped through the parent thread
- returns the original stored media type

Errors:

- `404` attachment not found
- `404` attachment file missing on disk
